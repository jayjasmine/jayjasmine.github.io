            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <h5>​Aussie Kidz Charity was founded in 2000 by David Dahl and Ross Tisch. Both men were previously directors of another children’s charity and were tired of seeing funds increasingly spent on overheads and not the children in need. They set up Aussie Kidz Charity with the desire to see 100% of funds raised go directly to the children to help them with their needs.

                ​To date, Aussie Kidz has raised approximately $900,000 and has distributed these funds by way of 150 grants to kids in need. These funds have been used to purchase equipment and services for disabled and under-privileged children from all over Australia.</h5>
