**Sell your design to client (teacher). Describe how it meets client objectives**

The landing page was designed with the goal of supporting the copy in converting traffic to donors.Â 

To achieve this, the website ensures high usability by adopting accessibility standards and responsive navigation. Readability standards are employed to ensure copy can deliver the desired message unhindered. The navigation bar is sticky and responsive, allowing users on both mobile and desktop to navigate the page with ease.

Conversion-focused design methods are used to increase the impact of the copy. Sections flow to each other with vibrant imagery and white space, helping to break up the text and keep readers engaged. Supportive images are specifically chosen to promote the emotion their respective copy is attempting to evoke. Aussie Kidz branding conventions are consistent throughout the design, strengthening the users brand awareness and trust. Finally, the CTA button to donate is ever-present within the navigation bar as the user scrolls, with the final section strongly promoting the donation button within the visual hierarchy.

We are confident the overall layout, imagery and user experience will successfully support the copy, and lead to an increase in conversions.
